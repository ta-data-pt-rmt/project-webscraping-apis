## Project Description
We have created Travelapp to simplify traveling experience through providing real-time information to make planning any trip easier. This is done through web scraping three resources to get information on flights, events, to-do's and restaurants. Having all the possible information in front of your eyes in real-time will allow our customer an easier planning in logistic and financial aspect.

## Hypotheses / Questions
Can we make travel planning easier? We want a place that gives information in real time and helps organize and plan logistically and financially any trip one can think of.

## Dataset
Where did you get your data? What dataset did you use or did you build your own datset? If so, did you use an API? Did you scrape a web? Provide links to the data if available.

booking.com used via Selenium to get the information on recommended flights based on the wanted destination.
eventbrite.com via Selenium to get the information on events, especially free ones. 
tripadvisor.com via Selenium to get information on restaurants, to-dos and tours.
Based of the information we scraped, we created the datasets we needed and then exported all of them in a cvs file.

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What were the steps you went through?

First, we met and planned the workflow and the steps we needed to cross. 
We listed potential websites that would be interesting to scrape, and each choose a website to focus on scraping.
The scraping method was optional, and somehow all three websites ended up being scraped with Selenium.
After we got the data, we created the joint file to have all the information in one place and create the datasets we needed.
We managed to export the data in and csv file to include the information of all the datasets we wanted to show.
